## Build the service
The service is already built Just go ahead and use it.

### Optional
If you are interested in starting from scratch then follow [this Quikstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy) to get the basic node.js service running.

Create a public directory in the folder and add all the .js and index.html files donwloaded from p5.js

essentially just calling the index.html from the node.js service.
